# comp20-hvoelker
COMP 20 Spring 2017 Private Repo for Hannah Voelker

# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to store relevant labs and homeworks for comp 20 in a format that allows revision control as well as the ability for Ming/the TAs to view my work and my commits.

# Favorite Assignment
Definitely the server side for the black car service. For me, I knew a decent amount of HTML/CSS/JS going into the course, so I think this was the assignment that really pushed me the most. I love a good challenge, and it was fun to try to figure things out by reading documentation as well as trial and error.

I think I have grown a decent amount since day 1. I also really understand how the web works on a larger scale, which is something not all programmers know, and it will definitely be useful going to more complex projects.

# Most important thing I have learned
Do *not* trust the user: If security vulnerabilities exist in a website, someone will exploit them 
- Example: the 0.99$ flatscreen exploit reading 
- Example: Bypassing 2FA on Paypal
This has taught me to code with security in mind -- something I hadn't really considered before as I was working on small side-projects. This is SO important before I write code that will actually be shipped to production for internships/jobs.

# Next Deep Dive
Now that this course is over, I'd like to take a deeper dive on using cloud resources such as AWS for application hosting/usage. They say everything is moving in that direction, and AWS has a lot of cool services, so it would be fun to learn more.
