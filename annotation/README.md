# Comp 20, Lab 4
"The Epic Fail"
Objective: Help Mariah sing by adding annotations to her video. 

###Implemented correctly:
Used JS to add lyrics underneath the video. Timing of lyrics is approximated based on her official music video for "Emotions" on Youtube. I did not modify any of the html file except within the script tags. I used one css file for some styling. 

###Collaborations:
I didn't work with anyone on this assignment. I used the links provided with the lab as well as some prior knowledge in order to complete this assignment.

###Time commitment:
This lab took me around an hour.
