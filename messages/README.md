Use jquery to make life easier

### Correctly implemented:
- Use jQuery to duplicate the XMLHttpRequest example from class.
- I did not directly modify the html body
- I did not use for or while loops
- I did not use document.getElementById

### Collaborations
I did not work with anyone.

### Time allotment
This lab took me 15 minutes.
