# Assignment 2: Black Car Service
Make a simple mock uber using XMlHttpRequests.

# Implemented correctly:
- Use of navigator.geolocation object to retrieve my lat & long + display of me as a unique marker
- Use of JavaScript XMLHttpRequest to obtain information about other users
- When clicking on my marker, you get my username. If you click on another user's marker, you get their name and how many miles away they are. 
- Use of conditionals in order to be covered in the event that I am changed from a passenger to a driver.
- Only one info window per page to avoid overcrowding.

# Collaborations
I didn't collaborate with anyone, but I did ask some questions on Piazza when I hit a weird bug-- I didn't originally include the geometry library (Thanks, Ming!). 

# Time allotment
I spent a total of ~2.5 hours on this assignment, with a large chunk of that time being debugging. I didn't work for a contiguous amount of time, mostly just in 20-30 min chunks across the weekend.
