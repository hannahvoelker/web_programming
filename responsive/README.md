# Responsive Design 
## Comp 20 Spring 2017, Lab 4

This lab was introduced to us to teach responsive deisgn. 
The rules for the ralphy image:
* If the browser screen width is greater than 1400 pixels, display the top-left image of ralphy.gif
* If the browser screen width is greater than 1200 pixels but less than or equal to 1400 pixels, display the top-right image of ralphy.gif
* If the browser screen width is greater than 1000 pixels but less than or equal to 1200 pixels, display the left image of the middle row of ralphy.gif (e.g., "Now you listen to me!...")
* If the browser screen width is greater than 800 pixels but less than or equal to 1000 pixels, display the right image of the middle row of ralphy.gif (e.g., "And the only reason I gave...")
* If the browser screen width is greater than 600 pixels but less than or equal to 800 pixels, display the bottom-left image of ralphy.gif
* If the browser screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, display the last image, bottom-right.

### Correctly Implemented
My image scales correctly following the rules above, when changing the browser width in chrome. My screen maxes out before 1400 pixels, so the first rule I couldn't test on my machine. However, I asked a peer to check on his larger computer and it was fine. 

### Collaborations
I did this lab completely on my own. I used the links provided in the assignment sheet to help me understand how image slicing works, as well as what syntax is used for responsive design.

### Time commitment
This lab took me ~20 mins.
